``` r

```

The dataset contains subway line information, station names, latitude
and longitude, the routes served, whether there’s an entrance, vending
availability, entrance type (stair or elevator), and ADA compliance.

My data cleaning steps include converting all missing values to “NA”,
converting column names to a consistent format: lower case, replacing
spaces and special characters with underscores, retaining the variables
that are useful for later, and converting entry variable from character
to logical variable.

The resulting dataset has 1868 rows and 13 columns.

These data is tidy except the routes served. It would be better to have
a variable “route(s)” with one row for each combination of entrance and
route.

Answer the following questions using these data: 1. How many distinct
stations are there? Note that stations are identified both by name and
by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st Broadway; 125st Lenox); the
distinct function may be useful here.

``` r
distinct_stations = nyc_subway %>%
  distinct(station_name, line)

num_distinct_stations = nrow(distinct_stations)

num_distinct_stations
```

    ## [1] 465

- There are 465 distinct stations.

2.  How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
ada_complicant = nyc_subway %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line, ada) |> 
  distinct()

num_adacomplicant = nrow(ada_complicant)

num_adacomplicant
```

    ## [1] 84

- There are 84 stations are ADA compliant.

3.  What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance?

``` r
allow_entrance = nyc_subway %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean()

allow_entrance
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

- The proportion is 0.377.

“person” indicates which Trash Wheel (Mr Trash Wheel, Professor Trash
Wheel, or Gwynnda Trash Wheel). The variable “dumpster” indicates the
dumpter number. There are also self-explanatory variables including date
of collection, amount of total litter and litter type.

``` r
write.csv(combined_dataset, 
          file = "combined_dataset.csv", 
          row.names = FALSE)
```

For data cleaning, I first imported all datasets and converted missing
values to NA. In the ‘bakers’ dataset, observations listed as “N/A” were
treated accordingly. After reviewing the imported data, I noticed that
the column names in the ‘results’ dataset had an incorrect format, so I
renamed them and removed any empty rows and columns. In the ‘bakers’
dataset, the variable for the bakers’ names is labeled “baker name,”
while in the other two datasets, it is simply called “baker.” To join
the datasets, I renamed “baker name” to “baker.” Additionally, the
‘bakers’ dataset includes full names, whereas the other datasets only
contain first names, so I modified the ‘bakers’ dataset to include only
first names. After attempting to join the datasets, I found that the
“series” and “episode” columns in the ‘results’ dataset were stored as
characters instead of integers, so I converted them to integers.

To have the final dataset, I used ‘full_join’ and ‘right_join’ function
to join 3 datasets all together. The final dataset has 1136 observations
in total. I put the bakers’ name at the first column. The final dataset
has the data of every baker’s name, age, and occupation in every series
and episode with valid data in terms of signature bake, show topper,
hometown, technical, and result.

The final dataset still has some issues. First, there are remaining
missing values in the dataset. Second, since the ‘results’ dataset
contains more bakers than the other two datasets, using the left_join
function would result in the loss of many observations from the
‘results’ dataset.

  filter(series >= 5) %>%

Some bakers repeatedly won Star Baker throughout the series, making
their eventual win more predictable. For instance, Richard from Season 5
won Star Baker an impressive five times, signaling him as a clear
front-runner, even though he didn’t win the final. Similarly, Nadiya in
Season 6 and Steph in Season 10 both had multiple Star Baker titles
(Nadiya had three, Steph had four), marking them as favorites for the
title. Nadiya went on to win her season, making her victory less
surprising due to her consistent performance.
